## Problem Input Formatting

### Problem 1
input.txt should be formatted using a single space delimiter between 2D array values,
and a new line character for every row.

Valid example for input.txt:
```
0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0
```

The result is printed to output.txt in the same format

### Problem 2
input.txt should be formatted using a single space delimiter between array values

Valid example for input.txt:
```
3.14 -0.5 42.0 0.001 2.71828 100.5 -3.14 1.618 5.0
```

You will be promoted via the console to either pick MergeSort or QuickSort
The execution time will be printed into the console, and the result printed to output.txt in the same format

### Problem 3
input.txt should be formatted using a single space delimiter between array key values

Valid example for input.txt:
```
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

You will be promoted via the console to either pick MaxHeap or MinHeap.
The execution time will be printed into the console, and the result printed to output.txt in the same format

### Problem 4
input.txt should be formatted with the first line being the pattern string and the second being the text

Valid example for input.txt:
```
test
this is a test string
```

The execution time will be printed into the console, and the result printed to output.txt in the same format

### Problem 5
input.txt should be formatted using a single space delimiter between 2D array values,
and a new line character for every row.

Valid example for input.txt:
```
0.0 2.5 9.1 4.0
2.5 0.0 3.3 6.7
9.1 3.3 0.0 1.2
4.0 6.7 1.2 0.0
```

The result is printed to output.txt in the same format
